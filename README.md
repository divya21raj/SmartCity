# SmartCity
Mini Project for Intro to Java course

You're dropped in a city, with a task to explore it.....and you're not alone, you're joined by
the sometimes annoying "Smart Drones", and all the other users of the program.

This multiple user feature can be made as an online model, but currently it's all on my Hard disk, hence one user has
to quit the program before another user can use it.

Current Status:
-Everything works except the Cop Drone, Mini Mart.
